This script upgrades the agents across all tenants, workflow:

1. Get all tenant IDs across cluster.
2. Get all Agent IDs per tenants.
3. Get all Agents unassigned to tenants.
4. Upgrade the agents if they are upgradeable to current release.

## Usage: 
```
python upgrade_agents.py
```

## Connect to the Cohesity Cluster
```
cohesity_client = CohesityClient(cluster_vip=CLUSTER_VIP,
                                 username=CLUSTER_USERNAME, 
                                 password=CLUSTER_PASSWORD,
                                 domain=DOMAIN)
```

## Get Tenants

```python
resp_tenants = cohesity_client.tenant.get_tenants()
```

## Get Agents
```python
resp_agents = cohesity_client.protection_sources.list_protection_sources(
                              tenant_ids=tenant,
                              environments=EnvironmentEnum.KPHYSICAL)
```

## Upgrade Agent list
```python

body = UpgradePhysicalServerAgents()
body.agent_ids = [agent_id1, agent_id2, agent_id3]
result = cohesity_client.protection_sources.create_upgrade_physical_agents(body)
```

Tenant list: [u'coke/', u'pepsi/', u'coco/', u'alo/'] 

Adding agent: windows_agent to upgrade list

Adding agent: linux_agent to upgrade list
Adding agent: solaris_agent to upgrade list
Upgrading agents: [u'windows_agent', u'linux_agent', u'solaris_agent']
Agents upgraded [u'windows_agent', u'linux_agent', u'solaris_agent']
